## General info
This repository is on Machine Learning using Python 3.8.3 using Visual Studio Code. Most of the programs are from IBM Machine Learning course and some algorithms (course out of scope) are presenterd only for learning purpose. These codes will be on topics like Regression, Classification, Clustering and Recommender Systems. 

## Code setup Information

* The code is writin in Visual Studio code using Python extension with Python 3.8.3 installed on the system. 
* Output results are written in text file (.txt)
* The illustrations are saved as eps and using latex, each documentation is created as .pdf

### Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

* Python files: Simple_Regression_example.py, Multiple_Regression.py
* Date file: FuelConsumptionCo2.csv
* A fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada. Source: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64
* Output file: LinearReg.txt, MultipleReg.txt

### Ordinal Logistic Regression

* Python files: Ordinal_Regression_example.py
* Date file: datasets_228_482_diabetes.csv
* Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
* Output file: LogReg.txt

### Non-Linear Regression

* Python files: Non_Linear.py, Non_Linear_Regression.py
* Date file: china_gdp.csv
* The dataset corresponding to China's GDP from 1960 to 2014. This dataset has two columns, the first, a year between 1960 and 2014, the second, China's corresponding annual gross domestic income in US dollars for that year. 
* Output file: NonLinearReg.txt


## Classification

* Separate folder '[Classification](#classification)' for working on different (categorical) datasets and applying different Classification algorithms such as KNN, Decision Tree, Logisitc Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Clustering

* Separate folder '[Clustering](#clustering)' for working on different datasets and applying different Clustering algorithms such as K-means (Partitioning Clustering), Agglomerative (Hierarchical Clustering) and DBSCAN (Density Based Clustering)
