# Classification
* K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm for supervised machine learning. In this algorithm, once a point is to be predicted, it takes into account the 'K' nearest points to it to determine it's classification.

### K-Nearest Neighbors

* Python files: KNN_example.py, KNN_k_values.py

* Telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service. Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
* Two python files: One for finding K value for highest accuracy achievable and another one for KNN classifier algorithm.
* Output file: KNN.txt, KNN_kvalue.txt
